---

## Server Setup Configurations

- Python 3.8+
- Python Virtual Environment
- A production-ready WSGI server (e.g., **uWSGI**)
- Redis installed and configured
- Mysql installed and configured
- Nginx or Apache as a reverse proxy (optional but recommended)



- **Virtual Environment Creation &  Configuration**:  
  - Create a virtual environment

    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    ```
  - Activate the virtual environment

    ```bash
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
  - Set environment variables for database credentials, Redis, and Flask settings (e.g., `FLASK_ENV=production`).  

---
### 2. Install Dependencies  
 - Make sure all required dependencies are installed: 

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
---
### 3. Configure the Application

- **Update Configuration Files**:
  - Edit the database configuration in the `Database/` directory.
  - Ensure Redis settings in `Modules/redis_manager.py` are correct for your production environment.

---

### 4. Use UWSGI for WSGI Server

- Run the application using **uWSGI**:

    ```bash
    uwsgi --ini uwsgi.ini
    ```
---

### 5. Configure Reverse Proxy (Optional but Recommended)
 - Use Nginx to serve as a reverse proxy to forward requests to Gunicorn. Example Nginx configuration:

    ```bash
        server {
            listen 80;
            server_name yourdomain.com;

            location / {
                proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
                proxy_set_header Host $host;
                proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
                proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
                proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
            }

            error_page 500 502 503 504 /50x.html;
            location = /50x.html {
                root /usr/share/nginx/html;
            }
        }
    ```
- Restart Nginx to apply the configuration:

    ```bash
        sudo systemctl restart nginx
    ```
---

### 6. Enable HTTPS (Optional but Recommended)
- Use Let's Encrypt or another SSL provider to secure your application. For Let's Encrypt:

    ```bash
    sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
    sudo certbot --nginx -d yourdomain.com
    ```
---

### 7. Background Tasks (Redis Setup)
- Ensure Redis is running:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl start redis
    sudo systemctl enable redis
    ```
    - Verify Redis Installation:
    - To confirm Redis is correctly installed and running, use the following commands:

    ```bash
    redis-cli ping
    ```
 - If Redis is running, it will return:

    ```bash
     PONG
    ```
    ### Securing Redis:

    For a production environment, follow these steps to secure Redis:

    1. Bind Redis to localhost (to prevent external access): Edit the Redis configuration file (usually located at `/etc/redis/redis.conf)`:

        ```bash
        bind 127.0.0.1
        ```
    2. Require a Password: Uncomment and set a strong password in the same configuration file:

        ```bash
        requirepass your-strong-password
        ```

    3. Restart Redis to apply changes:

        ```bash
        sudo systemctl restart redis
        ```

    ### Monitor Redis Performance:

    To monitor Redis logs and performance:

    - Check Logs
        ```bash
        sudo journalctl -u redis
        ```
    - Use the `INFO` command to see details about memory usage, connections, and more:

        ```bash
        redis-cli INFO
        ```

    By following these steps, you ensure that Redis is not only running but also secure and optimized for `Production use`. This addition includes security measures and monitoring tips that are essential for a `Reliable Production Setup`.
