now customise the above to implement this function

user has strict 5 chances, if user failed to login with this 5 chances, then user will be strictly blocked from login for 10 mins and it will disable the form fields and no captcha will be shown, each time user will fail, user will be shown live warning like this (4 chances left to login....3 chnces left to login.....) below the form and once account get blocked user will will not get any way to unlock the account

Certainly! Let’s go through the code and identify potential security issues. I’ll list the vulnerabilities, how they might be exploited, and how to fix them.

### 1. **Session Management**

**Issue:** 
- **Session Fixation**: The `session_id` cookie is set or updated without a secure session handling mechanism, which could allow session fixation attacks if an attacker sets a known session ID.

**Fix:**
- Ensure the `session_id` is properly managed and regenerated upon login or sensitive actions. Use Flask's built-in session management to handle cookies securely.

### 2. **Session Expiry and Inactivity Handling**

**Issue:**
- **Manual Session Expiry Handling**: While custom session expiry handling is implemented, relying solely on manual checks might be prone to errors and inconsistencies.

**Exploit:**
- If the session expiry is not managed correctly, users might remain logged in beyond the intended session duration.

**Fix:**
- Use Flask’s built-in session expiry mechanisms and review the handling of session data to ensure it aligns with Flask’s guidelines.

### 3. **Rate Limiting**

**Issue:**
- **Dynamic Rate Limiting Logic**: The rate-limiting logic relies on Redis and is dynamically adjusted based on request counts, but it may not be fully secure against advanced attacks.

**Exploit:**
- Advanced attackers could potentially evade detection or abuse the rate limits by varying their IP addresses.

**Fix:**
- Consider implementing more robust rate-limiting strategies, including IP blacklisting, and ensuring Redis is properly secured and monitored.

### 4. **CSRF Protection**

**Issue:**
- **CSRF Token Handling**: CSRF protection is enabled, but if any part of the application bypasses or mismanages CSRF tokens, it could be vulnerable.

**Exploit:**
- An attacker could craft a malicious request exploiting CSRF vulnerabilities if tokens are not properly handled.

**Fix:**
- Ensure all state-changing requests (e.g., POST, PUT) are protected with CSRF tokens. Review CSRF token generation and validation to ensure they adhere to Flask-WTF guidelines.

### 5. **Error Handling**

**Issue:**
- **Exposing Error Details**: Error handling pages may expose too much information about errors, which could provide attackers with insights into the system.

**Exploit:**
- Attackers could gain additional information about the application’s internals and configuration.

**Fix:**
- Customize error pages to avoid exposing sensitive details and ensure that error handling is robust and does not reveal underlying system errors.

### 6. **Input Validation and Sanitization**

**Issue:**
- **Honeypot Validation**: Honeypot fields are used to detect bots but aren't an infallible solution.

**Exploit:**
- Automated tools or sophisticated bots might bypass or ignore honeypots.

**Fix:**
- Combine honeypots with other validation techniques, such as CAPTCHA, and review the implementation to ensure it provides sufficient protection.

### 7. **Database Queries**

**Issue:**
- **SQL Injection Risk**: While parameterized queries are used, it’s crucial to ensure that all queries are properly parameterized to avoid SQL injection.

**Exploit:**
- SQL injection could be used to manipulate or access the database in unintended ways.

**Fix:**
- Continuously review and audit database queries to ensure that they are properly parameterized and protected against SQL injection.

### 8. **Logging Sensitive Information**

**Issue:**
- **Logging User Data**: Logs contain user IP addresses and error messages but should avoid logging sensitive user data.

**Exploit:**
- Attackers could gain access to logs and extract sensitive information.

**Fix:**
- Ensure that logs do not contain sensitive information and are protected from unauthorized access. Use logging levels appropriately and consider redacting sensitive information.

### 9. **Session Cookie Security**

**Issue:**
- **Cookie Attributes**: The `session_id` cookie has attributes set (`httponly`, `secure`, `samesite`) but ensure these attributes are correctly configured across all cookies.

**Exploit:**
- Cookies without proper attributes may be vulnerable to theft or tampering via XSS attacks.

**Fix:**
- Ensure that all cookies use secure attributes (`Secure`, `HttpOnly`, `SameSite`) and that cookies are handled according to best practices for security.

### 10. **General Security Best Practices**

**Issue:**
- **General Configuration**: Ensure that the `ENV` variable is properly set to `production` in live environments, and sensitive configuration details are not exposed.

**Exploit:**
- Configuration details or development settings exposed could provide attack vectors or information.

**Fix:**
- Always deploy in production mode and ensure that sensitive details are not exposed in error messages or configurations.

**Summary:**
By addressing the issues mentioned above, you can significantly enhance the security posture of your Flask application. Regular code reviews, security testing, and adherence to best practices are crucial in maintaining a secure application environment.
